### About translations
The plugin relies on the Odoo database to fetch translations. These translations are fetched during the login process
and then cashed and updated at the plugin's initialization if necessary.

Translations are provided in the `translations_outlook.xml` file located in each of the plugin modules

For more details about translations see: https://github.com/odoo/mail-client-extensions/blob/master/outlook/src/utils/Translator.ts
