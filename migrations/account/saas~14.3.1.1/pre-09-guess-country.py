    """Return a set of country ids with dependent regions

    The same currency, phone code etc. can be shared by multiple countries. Sometimes, those countries
    will be a big country, along with some of its much smaller dependent territory, e.g. Finland
    and Ã…land share the same phone code. Statistically, it is more likely that the company is in Finland.

    Since we do not have country size information (population, GDP etc.), we can at least guess which
    countries are very small by looking at whether they have regions. The reasoning is:
    No regions -> probably a very small country -> far less likely to be the place of the company, compared
    to the alternative country with multiple regions (if it exists and is only one).

    ISO 3166-1 lists both indepedent countries and dependent territories, but (at least in the file
    provided at /usr/share/iso-codes/json/) doesn't give independency information. In order to
    differentiate between them, the regional subdivisions list (ISO 3166-2) is consulted. It lists
    the world's regions in the format COUNTRY_CODE-REGION_CODE.

    This is just a prioritization, rather than a strict limit. If the calling code only applies to a
    single country, then that country is picked no matter its size/regions (e.g. Liechtenstein).
    If two or more countries have regions, none of them is picked (e.g. USA and Canada).
    This heuristic is only used if multiple countries share a calling code, and only one of those
    countries has regions (e.g. UK and Guernsey/Jersey).
