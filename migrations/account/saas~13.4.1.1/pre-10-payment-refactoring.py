        <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong></p>
        <p>
            Payments have been heavily refactored in Odoo 14.0.
            To make sure the upgrade of your payments is done correctly,
            you should ensure a few things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before upgrading:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Check that the lock dates for all companies are correctly set;
                    the more recent the lock date, the better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check if the default accounts on the bank/cash journal is of type liquidity (bank/cash):
                <ul>
                    <li>In case they are, new outstanding payment accounts will be created during the migration.</li>
                    <li>In case they are current asset accounts, no new account will be created.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure all accounting entries have a consistant number regarding the fiscal year they belong to.
                    (e.g. a journal entry dated of 2019 shouldnâ€™t have a name xx/2020/xx/xxxx)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            After upgrading:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Check the outstanding payment accounts are correctly created.
                    You will have to change the code/name to fit your own chart of accounts.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Check that pre-recorded payments
                (recorded before migration, using the "register payment" button on invoices)
                in the not-locked periods can correctly be reconciled (after migration) with an incoming statement.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We highly encourage you to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOxsB7F6omY" target="_blank">this video</a>
            explaining the differences between Odoo 13.0 and Odoo 14.0 when registering payments. You will need to decide
            which workflow you want to use. By default the upgrade will assume that your workflow is to reconcile all
            payments on invoices with bank transactions. Invoices will be marked "in payment" when a payment is registered
            and will only be marked as "paid" after reconciling with a bank transaction. If reconciling bank transactions
            is not part of your workflow, you should change the outstanding account for incoming and / or outgoing payments
            on the relevant bank journal to the bank account of that journal. If this is done, payments registered on
            invoices result in them being marked as "paid" right away, and it will no longer be possible to reconcile a bank
            transaction with them.
