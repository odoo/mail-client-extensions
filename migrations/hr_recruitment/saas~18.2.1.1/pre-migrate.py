    # Some terminology to hopefully make this migration a bit easier to understand
    # ---
    # Before migration:
    #
    # hr.candidate -> A model that is meant to represent a person. This model contains all the contact information such as
    #                 name, phone, email etc. A candidate/person can apply to multiple jobs within the same company
    # hr.applicant -> A model that is meant to represent one application to one job position by one candidate, Most of
    #                 the information on this model, such as the contact information, is related fields from the candidate
    #                 so the actual applicant model does not contain that much information.
    #
    # Note:
    # - A candidate can have 0, 1, or multiple applications.
    # - An application can NOT have multiple candidates.
    # - An application can only be for ONE job position.
    #
    # ---
    # After migration:
    #
    # hr.candidate -> Removed.
    # hr.applicant -> Now it holds all the contact information about a person(all the previously related fields from
    #                 candidate) as well as an application to a single job position.
    # hr.talent.pool -> A way to group or collect applications together. Similar to a how a job groups together all
    #                   the applications that are applying for that job, or how the tag "developer" groups together all
    #                   the "developer" applications.
    #
    # Notes:
    # - An application that is linked to a talent pool (often referred to as a talent here) is NOT linked to any job position.
    # - Similarly an applicant that is linked to a job position (normal application) should NOT be linked to a talent pool.
    # - One could view talents as 'template applications' for a specific human so when a talent applies for a new job position
    #   the talent record is duplicated, talent_pool_ids is removed from the duplicate and a job_id added.
    # - Therefor it is vital that we don't add existing applications to a talent pool and rather create new ones.
    # - One talent record can belong to many talent pools (m2m relationship).
    #
    # ---
    # The general strategy for the migration can be explained as such:
    # 1. If candidate has only 1 application
    #     - Move info(phone, email, etc.) from candidate to applicant
    #     - Move notes/chatter to applicant
    #     - Move activities to applicant
    #     - Move meetings to applicant
    # 2. If candidate has != 1 application
    #     - Create a talent pool with the name 'Candidates'
    #     - Create a new applicant (talent)
    #     - Move all information and references from the candidate to the newly created talent
    #     - link the talent to the talent pool 'Candidates'
    #     - Link all the applications from the candidate to the new applicant(talent) through pool_applicant_id
    #     - Copy info(phone, email, etc.) from the candidate/talent to all the linked applications.
    #     - Copy/duplicate skills from the candidate to all the linked applications, including the talent.
    #
    # The idea behind this twofold strategy is to try to minimize clutter in customers databases. If most, or all, of the
    # candidates only have a single application, it can be interpreted that the customer did not utilize the candidate
    # mechanism in any useful manner (managing multiple applications for the same human etc), and therefor it is no need to
    # clutter up the database and set up a talent pool for the candidates. However, if the candidates contain either 0 or
    # more than 1 application it means that the candidate mechanism was properly used and we should do all we can to
    # preserve that behavior (following step 2 of the strategy).
