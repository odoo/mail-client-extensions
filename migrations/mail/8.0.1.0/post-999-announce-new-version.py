- Updated Instant Messaging App: the instant messaging system is now more robust
  and is now a platform on which new kinds of instant notifications can be
  added in the future.

- Improved User Interface:

{saas5_ui}
    - New layout for advanced search: the search drawer (opened with the small arrow on the right of search boxes) will
      now appear as a header on top of the search results. It will also be open by default in reporting views, making it
      much simpler to toggle filters and groupings while analyzing reports.
    - Faster unified search box: the search box will now allow instant search for the most common
      cases, instead of waiting for auto-completed results. Auto-completion (e.g. customer names, etc.) is only
      performed on demand by clicking on the relevant search option (or using the keyboard arrows)
    - Unified menu bar allows you to switch easily between the frontend (website) and backend
    - The search results panel is now scrollable independently of the menu bars, keeping the navigation,
      search bar and view switcher always within reach.
- User signature is now in HTML format, allowing rich text.
- Odoo 8.0 is now powered by a new API (application programming interface) that makes writing new Apps
  much simpler and quicker.
- Removed support for Outlook and Thunderbird plugins
